    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I want to start this off with something everyone is most probably thinking: “What a time to be alive!” Unfortunately, right now, this sentence would not be uttered with the usual cheer and merry, but more as a dreaded observation of the almost apocalyptic state of the world. However, if there is one industry prospering more than ever in this time, it has to be streaming services!</p>
<p>There is something to be said about the popularity of streaming in these bizare times when reading headlines like “Netflix Will Reduce The Quality of Streaming in Europe to Prevent Internet Congestion”. And so, while everyone is stuck inside with nothing else to do than stream “Friends” on Netflix, I wanted to explore how do these online platforms like Netflix and even social media sites and sales platforms know what to show us next?</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-netflix-recommendation-system-work">How does the Netflix recommendation system work?</h3>
<p>The prerequisite to any quality streaming service or sales platform in modern day is the recommendation system – YouTube has it, as well as Spotify, Reddit, Amazon and of course – Netflix. The way that these websites seem to “know” which snippet of content you would most likely enjoy is by using recommender systems and more precisely in modern day - some type of hybrid of collaborative filtering. In layman’s terms this means the machine analyses the viewing habits of a large group of people to determine users with similar tastes and preferences, and then recommends further content to the various groups based on this data.</p>
<p>I would like to dwell deeper into the inner working of Netflix in particular – let&rsquo;s find out how the streaming service employs its users to generate a recommendation algorithm that keeps improving itself to keep the viewers hooked. This algorithm has to comply to the restrictions placed upon it by the different content available to various countries and regions. It is also of interest how a new piece of media is filtered once it is released – generally new content is usually advertised to everyone using the service, but I would like to find out what happens once the novelty of the media artefact has worn off. Also of interest - how do recommender systems deal with new users with no previous history of media consumption? How do they hook these people in to even start building their recommendation timeline?</p>
<p>I think this topic is also highly important taking into account the current political climate - people do not realise how easily they can find themselves in an information echo-chamber. What I mean by this is that with recommendation systems on any internet site the process inevitably feeds the users bias. If one consumes media that supports a certain outlook, belief or theory, further similar content will be recommended, making it appear as if everything around the user agrees with their preconception. For example, If I was a major fan of true crime and consequently watched tons of documentaries and shows on this topic, my Youtube, Netflix and news site recommendations would present more and more crime content, making it appear to me that crime is more prevalent than it most probably truly is.</p>
<p>The same can happen with political, religious, pseudoscience content and so on. This is also a large source of obsessed conspiracy theorists - because after one video on the “flat earth” the person can suddenly be bombarded with so much content as to make the ludicrous conclusions seem widely believed, relevant and true. This is a bigger concern for information source media like news sites and even youtube, but I think Netflix has just as much of a chance to create an eco chamber for the viewer - albeit in the form of a very entertaining timesink.</p>
